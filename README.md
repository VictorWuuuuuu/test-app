Hi! Here is my Streamlit app!

So there is not much to note about the project, but that I did try to explore different parts of Streamlit and looked at what was cool or not.
I would say this is far from being polished, however I do think this is a good app. One key note, is that the graph may not work for all datasets because of how it is, but I wanted to try it out!

This app starts you off on a Summary page where the user is instructed to input a dataset (csv files) and gets some pieces of data to get the user started. There is also something cheeky if a condition is fulfilled. Then, they will be directed to the EDA portion of the app where there will be different options to interact with the data. 

The main part will be within whether they choose to look at 'Numerical' or 'Categorical' data. 

The numerical page will provide a kernel density estimation, and then the user can put in an extra option of sorting by a particular category. If a category is picked, this will create a stacked kernel density estimation. The user also has some options with labeling it.

The categorical page, after choosing a specific category, will show the user a cumulative density table. There will also be a bar chart where the user can change the dimensions of the chart.

I had a lot of fun making this and this has taught me a lot about just working with apps in general!
